# Action Counter for CIAM JSON Exports

This script analyzes a CIAM (Customer Identity and Access Management) JSON export file and reports:

- The number of procedures (subjourneys)
- The number of `action` objects within each procedure
- The number of `metadata` actions within journey (policy) workflows
- Summary statistics such as the max and average action counts

It supports output in either JSON or CSV format based on user input.

## üìÑ Output Files

The output files are saved in the current directory and named using the input filename plus the suffix `_actionCount`.

### JSON Output

If `json` is selected, output is saved to:

```
<inputFile>_actionCount.json
```

The JSON includes:

- Total number of procedures
- Actions per procedure
- Actions per policy
- Summary report:
  - Max procedure
  - Max policy
  - Average actions per procedure
  - Average actions per policy

---

### CSV Output

If `csv` is selected, output is saved to:

```
<inputFile>_actionCount.csv
```

The CSV includes:

| Category   | Name                           | Actions |
|------------|--------------------------------|---------|
| SubJourney | SJ_ENROLL_CUSTOMER_V1         | 22      |

## üîç What Does It Analyze?

- **Subjourneys**: Looks for `"action"` keys to determine how many logical steps are defined in each procedure.
- **Journeys (Policies)**: Analyzes the first version of each policy's workflow and counts nodes with `"metadata"` defined.
- Only `"metadata"` and `"action"` objects are considered significant for the counts.

## üì¶ Example Output (JSON)

```json
{
  "procedureCount": 46,
  "procedureActions": [
    { "procedureName": "SJ_LOGIN", "actionCount": 18 },
    { "procedureName": "SJ_REGISTER", "actionCount": 24 }
  ],
  "actionsUnderPolicies": {
    "LOGIN_POLICY": 10,
    "REGISTER_POLICY": 14
  },
  "report": {
    "maxProcedure": {
      "procedureName": "SJ_REGISTER",
      "actionCount": 24
    },
    "maxPolicy": {
      "policyId": "REGISTER_POLICY",
      "actionCount": 14
    },
    "averageProcedureActions": 21,
    "averagePolicyActions": 12
  }
}
```
